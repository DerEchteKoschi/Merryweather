##  Development Setup

### Docker

### Initial Setup

### Debugging
XDebug is configured to only activate when a trigger is present. The easiest way to
do this is to install a [browser extension](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/browser-debugging-extensions.html).
These will give you the option to only activate debugging, profiling or tracing when you really need it.

Only option to set is the IDE Key. This has to be "PHPSTORM", even if you're not using PHPStorm.
